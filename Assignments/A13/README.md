# 1749 - Airport Construction

## Summary
Essentially, the backstory behind this problem is that this small tourist island is in need of creating an airstrip. However, this airstrip must be as big as possible so that they can bring in bigger planes which means more people. Put simply, the problem is one that requires us to take a polygon, and calculate the longest line segment that can fit within its bounds.

## Problem Break Down
The algorithms to solve this depend on how precise of an answer you need. As described in the PDF, the answer must have an absolute or relative error of at most 10^-6. Thats a lot of fucking decimal places.
